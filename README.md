# Challange Description

## Overview

You have been hired by a company that builds a app for coffee addicts. You are 
responsible for taking the userâ€™s location and returning a list of the three closest coffee shops.

## Starting point
Fork or clone our ruby starter project: https://github.com/Agilefreaks/ruby-interview-starting-point

## Input

The coffee shop list is a comma separated file with rows of the following form:
`Name,Y Coordinate,X Coordinate`

The quality of data in this list of coffee shops may vary. Malformed entries should cause the 
program to exit appropriately. 

Notice that the data file will be read from an network location
(ex: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Agilefreaks/test_oop/master/coffee_shops.csv)

## Output

Write a REST API in any framework you wish (excluding Rails) that offers the posibility to take the user's coordinates and
return a list of the three closest coffee shops (including distance from the user) in 
order of closest to farthest. These distances should be rounded to four decimal places. 

Assume all coordinates lie on a plane.

## Example

Using the [coffee_shops.csv](coffee_shops.csv)

__Input__

`47.6 -122.4`

__Expected output__

```
Starbucks Seattle2,0.0645
Starbucks Seattle,0.0861
Starbucks SF,10.0793
```

## Running the app
To run the app, I've created a rake task:
`rake server`
The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:9292`.
Also I made a rake task for running an interactive console:
`rake console`

## Example request
You can make a request to the API using `curl`:
```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:9292/api/v1/closest_coffee_shops?x=47.6&y=-122.4'
```

## Running the tests
You can run the tests:
`rake test`

## Environment variables
The app uses a `.env` file to load environment variables. If the `.env` file is not present, it will fallback to the default URL specified in the code. You can create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
